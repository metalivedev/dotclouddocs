Periodic Tasks
==============

You can run actions at periodic intervals that can be minutes, hours, days or
even months. Periodic tasks can be:

- Database maintenance (e.g: compacting);
- :doc:`Backups </guides/backups>`;
- Bulk E-mails (e.g: notifications, daily digest);
- A program polling a third party service to update your database...

Using cron

   $OpenBSD: crontab.5,v 1.24 2010/11/19 17:16:48 millert Exp $

Periodic tasks are run by *cron*, a background process that keeps track of a
list of jobs to execute at specified intervals. The list is written in a file
called a *crontab* with one job per line. For example, here is an hypothetic
crontab that execute a program everyday a 18:42 PM::

   42 18 * * * ~/current/jobs/fetch-picture-of-the-day

Each line has five fixed fields plus a command, here is how it is laid out::

   minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week command

Fields are separated by blanks or tabs. The command may be one or more fields
long. The allowed values for the fields are:

============  =========================================
Field         Allowed Values
============  =========================================
minute        \* or 0 to 59
hour          \* or 0 to 23
day-of-month  \* or 1 to 31
month         \* or 1 to 12 or a name (see below)
day-of-week   \* or 0 to 7 or a name (0 or 7 is Sunday)
command       text
============  =========================================

You can use range of numbers: a range is two numbers separated by a '-' and is
inclusive. For example "3-5" in an hour field specifies execution at hours 3, 4
and 5. An asterisk ("\*") is short form for a range of all allowed values.

Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges: following a range with
"/number" specifies skips of number through the range. For example, "0-23/2" can
be used in the hour field to specify command execution every other hour. Steps
are also permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say "every two hours",
just use "\*/2".

Fields can also be lists: a list is a set of numbers or ranges separated by
commas. For example: "1,2,5,9", "0-4,8-12".

Names can be used in the *month* and *day-of-week* fields. Use the first three
letters of the particular day or month. However, ranges or lists of names are
not allowed.

.. We are not talking about the shortcuts in the @ form because we would like to
   avoid people running cron jobs all at the same time.

Once written the crontab must be "registered" in cron to take effect, this is
done with the "crontab" command and the path to your crontab in parameter::

   $ crontab ~/current/jobs/crontab
   $ 

The best place to do this automatically is in the "postinstall" hook called
each time your application is built on your services. This is explained in the
:doc:`hooks guide </guides/hooks>`.

The crontab command can also be used to display the list of defined jobs and/or
to remove the jobs from the list::

   $ crontab -l
   42 18 * * * ~/current/jobs/fetch-picture-of-the-day
   $ crontab -r
   $ crontab -l
   no crontab for dotcloud
   $ 

.. note::

   Remember, do not forget to set the executable bit on your scripts with "chmod
   +x" (this is not needed on Windows).

You can find the original cron documentation here: `(5)crontab
<http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=crontab&sektion=5>`_.

Write Tasks In A Specific Language
----------------------------------

The programs executed by cron can be written as plain shell scripts but could
also be written in PHP (or even Python and Perl), do not forget to specify the
interpreter to use in the *first* line of your program using a shebang:

.. tabswitcher::

   .. tab:: PHP

      .. code-block:: php

         #!/usr/bin/env php
         <?php

             exit(0);

         ?>

   .. tab:: Ruby

      .. code-block:: ruby

         #!/usr/bin/env ruby

         exit 0

   .. tab:: Perl

      .. code-block:: perl

         #!/usr/bin/env perl

         use strict;
         use warnings;

         exit 0;

   .. tab:: Python

      .. code-block:: python

         #!/usr/bin/env python

         import sys

         sys.exit(0)

Forward The Tasks Output
------------------------

If you specify your E-mail address in your crontab, cron will use it to forward
the jobs output to you::

   MAILTO="louis+cron@company.com"
   42 18 * * * ~/current/jobs/fetch-picture-of-the-day
   21 9  4 * * ~/current/jobs/send-billing-reminder

.. note::

   Sending E-mails from DotCloud requires some care please have a look at the
   :doc:`sending E-mails </guides/emails>` page.
